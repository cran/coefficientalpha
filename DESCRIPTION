Description: Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega are widely used reliability or internal consistency measures in social, behavioral and education sciences. Alpha is reported in nearly every study that involves measuring a construct through multiple test items. The package 'coefficientalpha' calculates coefficient alpha and coefficient omega with missing data and non-normal data. Robust standard errors and confidence intervals are also provided. A test is also available to test the tau-equivalent and homogeneous assumptions. Since Version 0.5, the bootstrap confidence intervals were added.
